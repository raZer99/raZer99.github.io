title: "My Complete Spring 6 + Spring Boot Learning Journey – From Core Concepts to Secure Full-Stack Development"
date: 2025-10-25
categories: [Java, Spring Boot, Spring 6, Full Stack, Backend, Security]
---

Over the past few months, I’ve been on a deep and rewarding learning journey — starting from **core Java and Spring 6 fundamentals** to building **secure, full-stack applications** using **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Spring Security**.  

This entire path was guided by the excellent **[Telusko Spring 6 + Spring Boot Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7qbKoSgR5ub6jolI8-ocxCF)**, which helped me understand how each concept builds upon the previous one — from setting up a simple Spring project to developing production-ready applications.

### 🚀 What I Learned

I focused on building hands-on experience and applying concepts in real projects. Key highlights include:

#### 🖥️ Spring Core & Spring Boot
- Understanding **IoC (Inversion of Control)** and **Dependency Injection**
- Building modular, maintainable backend layers
- Configuring **Spring Boot 3** for REST APIs, layered architecture, and environment-specific profiles

#### 🗄️ Spring Data JPA
- Entity mapping and database relationships
- CRUD operations and repository patterns
- Integration with full-stack applications

#### 🔐 Spring Security
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, Bcrypt)
- OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub
- Securing REST APIs in real-world projects

#### 🏗️ Full-Stack Projects
- Bookstore API: implemented RESTful CRUD operations with JPA and layered architecture
- Spring E-Commerce Project: connected **React frontend** with Spring Boot backend
- Learned to handle **CORS**, API routes, and asynchronous data fetching

### 💡 Takeaways

This journey helped me not just learn frameworks, but **think like a backend engineer** — building secure, maintainable, and scalable applications.  
It also strengthened my **problem-solving, debugging, and full-stack integration skills**, which are critical for transitioning into a **Software Development Engineer (SDE)** role.  

---

### 🎯 Next Steps

I plan to:
- Explore **microservices architecture** with Spring Boot
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** for full-stack apps
- Deploy cloud-native applications using **AWS and Docker**
- Continue strengthening Spring Security knowledge and real-world backend skills

Thanks for reading! 🌱  
If you’re learning Spring 6 or Spring Boot, following along with projects like this is a great way to understand **backend fundamentals, security, and full-stack integration**.
