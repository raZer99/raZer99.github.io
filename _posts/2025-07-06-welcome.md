title: "Welcome — My Journey into Software Development 👾"
date: 2025-07-06

Hey there! I’m **Md Sameer**, a computer science student and aspiring **software developer** who’s currently learning Java, backend development, and real-world problem-solving through code.

This blog is a space where I’ll be sharing everything I learn — from core programming concepts to backend development fundamentals and beyond. Whether it’s figuring out how recursion actually works, or writing my first REST API, I’m documenting the process here to learn in public.

I'm still early in the journey — but I’m **passionate about building, improving, and getting better every day**.

## 🏗️ How I Built This Blog

This blog is powered by **Jekyll + GitHub Pages** using the clean and minimalist `minima` theme.

Built to serve as:
- A personal portfolio for recruiters
- A knowledge base for other devs
- A habit log for myself
