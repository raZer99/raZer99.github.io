Hey there! I’m **Md Sameer**, a computer science student and aspiring **software developer** who’s exploring **backend development, Spring Boot, Spring Security**, and **AI-powered applications**.  

This blog is a space where I’ll share everything I learn — from **core programming concepts** to **secure backend systems** and **full-stack integrations**. Whether it’s building a REST API, implementing JWT authentication, or experimenting with AI-driven features, I document it all to **learn in public**.  

I’m still early in the journey — but I’m **passionate about building, improving, and getting better every day**.

## 🏗️ How I Built This Blog

This blog runs on **Jekyll + GitHub Pages** using the minimalist `minima` theme.

It’s designed to serve as:
- A **personal portfolio** for recruiters
- A **knowledge base** for fellow developers
- A **habit log** for continuous learning
