title: "NeuroNexus – Building an AI-Driven Workflow Orchestration Platform with Spring Boot Microservices"

---

🚀 **NeuroNexus** is a production-style **workflow orchestration platform** built using Spring Boot microservices.  
It automates real DevOps/SRE workflows — from **ticket triage** and **team notifications** to **JIRA automation**, **deployments**, and **workflow auditing**.

This project helped me deeply explore **distributed microservices architecture**, **PostgreSQL persistence**, **REST-based orchestration**, and **Docker deployments**.

### 🏗️ What I Built

I developed **NeuroNexus**, a modular microservices-based platform that processes tickets, triages them with rule-based AI logic, and orchestrates sequential actions through a central Orchestrator.

#### 🖥️ Backend – Spring Boot Microservices
- **Tech Stack:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Lombok  
- **Features:**
  - Distributed microservices communicating via REST  
  - Workflow orchestration (notify → jira → deploy → log → complete)  
  - Keyword-based AI-style triage (upgradable later using Spring AI)  
  - PostgreSQL persistence for tickets + audit logs  
  - Clean separation of responsibilities across services

> NeuroNexus models real-world SRE/DevOps automation systems — combining microservices, workflow engines, auditing, and extensible orchestration.  
> *A strong portfolio project demonstrating backend engineering maturity.*

### 🧩 Microservices Included (Visual Overview)

#### **1️⃣ Ticket Service (8080)**
- Receives and stores tickets  
- Sends ticket to Triage Service  
- Triggers Orchestrator workflow  

#### **2️⃣ Triage Service (8081)**
Performs lightweight AI-style classification:

- Priority → **P1 / P2 / P3**  
- Owner team → **devops / db / network / auth**  
- Reason → auto-generated rule-based explanation  

#### **3️⃣ Orchestrator (8082)**
Executes workflow steps in order:
- `notify`
- `jira`
- `deployment`
- `log`
- `complete`  
- Saves workflow history to PostgreSQL  

#### **4️⃣ Action Services**
- **Notification Service (8083)** → Sends team alerts  
- **JIRA Service (8085)** → Creates incident tickets  
- **Deployment Service (8084)** → Simulates CI/CD deployment  

#### **5️⃣ PostgreSQL (Docker)**
Stores:
- Ticket data  
- Workflow history  
- Audit logs

### 🔄 How NeuroNexus Works (End-to-End Flow)

1. User submits a ticket → POST /tickets

2. Ticket Service:
     • Saves ticket in PostgreSQL
     • Forwards to Triage Service

3. Triage Service:
     • Analyzes description
     • Assigns priority & owner team
     • Returns enriched metadata

4. Ticket Service sends result to Orchestrator

5. Orchestrator processes workflow:
     notify → jira → deploy → log → complete

6. Saves workflow record to PostgreSQL

7. Final response returned to user

### 🎓 What I Learned

Building NeuroNexus helped me understand how real microservices communicate, coordinate, and execute workflows across a distributed system.

**Key takeaways:**
- Designing **loosely coupled microservices**
- Implementing **REST-based inter-service communication**
- Writing **dynamic workflow engines** using templates
- Using **PostgreSQL + Docker Compose** for persistent storage
- Applying **rule-based AI logic** for ticket triage**
- Structuring **large, scalable backend systems**
- Managing orchestration across **multiple independent services**

---

### 💡 Next Steps

I plan to extend NeuroNexus with:

- **Kafka** for event-driven orchestration  
- **Spring AI** for LLM-based triage  
- **Slack/Email** notification plugins  
- **Grafana + Prometheus** monitoring  
- **API Gateway + Service Registry** via Spring Cloud  
- **Role-based access control** for ticket actions  

These upgrades will move NeuroNexus closer to a fully **production-grade orchestration engine**.
