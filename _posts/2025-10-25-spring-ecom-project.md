🚀 **Spring E-Commerce Project** marks a major step in my Spring learning journey — evolving from understanding the **Spring Core** concepts to building a **full-stack web application** with **React** as the frontend and **Spring Boot** as the backend.

This project follows the [Spring 6 and Spring Boot Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7qbKoSgR5ub6jolI8-ocxCF) by **Telusko**, covering everything up to (but not including) Spring Security.

### 🏗️ What I Built

I developed a **full-stack e-commerce web application** that demonstrates real-world backend and frontend integration using Spring Boot and React (Vite).

#### 🖥️ Backend – Spring Boot
- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Maven  
- **Features:**
  - RESTful APIs for **Products**, **Categories**, and **Orders**
  - Full **CRUD operations**
  - Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
  - Proper **entity mapping** with JPA
  - Environment-specific configuration for flexible development

📂 **Repository:**  
👉 [raZer99/Spring-Ecom-Project](https://github.com/raZer99/Spring-Ecom-Project)  

> A full-stack e-commerce web app built with Spring Boot and React. Demonstrates RESTful APIs, JPA entity management, and dynamic product rendering using React and Context API.  
> *– part of my journey to master Spring Boot through real-world projects.*

#### 🌐 Frontend – React + Vite
- **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS  
- **Features:**
  - Integrated **React frontend** with the Spring backend
  - **Product listing and cart functionality**
  - Dynamic data fetching via REST APIs
  - Lightweight build system using **Vite**
  - State management using **Context API**

📂 **Repository:**  
👉 [raZer99/Spring-Ecom-Project-ReactFrontend](https://github.com/raZer99/Spring-Ecom-Project-ReactFrontend)  

> React frontend for the Spring E-Commerce Project. Implements product listing, cart, and CRUD integration with the Spring Boot backend — serving as the UI layer for the full-stack learning experience.

### 🎓 What I Learned

Working through this project taught me both **foundational Spring concepts** and how to connect them to a modern frontend stack.

Key takeaways:
- Understanding **Dependency Injection** and **Inversion of Control**
- Configuring and using **Spring Data JPA** for database operations
- Building modular, maintainable backend layers
- Connecting a **React frontend** to Spring REST APIs
- Handling **CORS**, API routes, and asynchronous data in React
- Full CRUD implementation from backend to frontend

---

### 💡 Next Steps

With this base in place, I plan to:
- Add **Spring Security + JWT authentication**
- Implement **Docker-based deployment**
- Host the full-stack app on **AWS**

These additions will transform the current setup into a fully production-ready system.

Thanks for reading! 🌱  
If you’re learning Spring Boot or React, this full-stack build is a fantastic way to understand how backend and frontend systems truly connect.
